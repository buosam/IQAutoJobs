# Incident Report: 502 Bad Gateway on Railway

## 1. Timeline of Events

*   **[Start Time]**: Reports of 502 Bad Gateway errors began.
*   **[Investigation Start Time]**: Incident response initiated.
*   **[Time of Fix]**: The root cause was identified and fixes were deployed.

## 2. Impact Scope

*   **Duration**: Intermittent failures during deployment and startup.
*   **Endpoints Affected**: All application endpoints.
*   **User Impact**: The application was unavailable during startup failures.

## 3. Root Cause(s)

The primary root cause of the 502 Bad Gateway error was an **application startup failure** in the production environment. This was caused by a **filesystem case-sensitivity mismatch**.

*   **Evidence**: The repository contained two directories: `backend/` and `Backend/`.
*   **Analysis**: While this may work in a case-insensitive local development environment (like macOS or Windows), it causes a `ModuleNotFoundError` in a case-sensitive environment (like the Linux containers used by Railway). The `wsgi.py` entrypoint correctly imported from `backend/`, but build or import tools may have been confused by the duplicate, leading to a fatal error at startup.

A secondary contributing factor was an excessively long **Gunicorn timeout** (`120` seconds), which masked the startup failure and increased the risk of the process being killed by the platform's reverse proxy.

## 4. Evidence

*   File listing confirmed the presence of both `backend/` and `Backend/` directories.
*   The `Procfile` contained the command `gunicorn wsgi:app --workers 2 --threads 4 --timeout 120 --bind 0.0.0.0:$PORT`.
*   The `wsgi.py` file contained the line `from backend.app import create_app`, confirming the correct module path.

## 5. Immediate Fixes Applied

1.  **Deleted `Backend/` Directory**: The extraneous `Backend/` directory was removed to resolve the filesystem case-sensitivity conflict.
2.  **Added Health Check Endpoint**: A `/healthz` endpoint was added to provide a fast, reliable signal of application health.
3.  **Hardened `Procfile`**: The Gunicorn command in the `Procfile` was updated to `gunicorn wsgi:app --workers 2 --timeout 60 --bind 0.0.0.0:$PORT`. The timeout was reduced to a safer value, and the `--threads` flag was removed as it has no effect with the default sync worker type, thus clarifying the concurrency configuration.

## 6. Preventive Actions

1.  **Runbook Creation**: A new runbook was created at `docs/runbook-railway-flask.md` to standardize deployment verification and rollback procedures.
2.  **Linting/CI Checks**: It is recommended to add a CI check that fails if it finds files or directories with case-sensitive name conflicts.
3.  **Platform Health Checks**: Configure Railway to use the new `/healthz` endpoint in its deployment process to ensure traffic is not routed to an unhealthy container.
