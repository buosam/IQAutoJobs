# Root-Cause Analysis Report: "Browse Jobs" Feature Failure

## 1. Executive Summary

The "Browse Jobs" feature on iqautojobs.com was non-functional due to a series of critical backend failures. The root cause was a combination of issues that prevented the application from starting, connecting to the database correctly, and fetching data. The primary issues were:

1.  **Backend Startup Failures:** The application was unable to start due to missing environment variables and an improperly managed `ProcessPoolExecutor`.
2.  **Synchronous/Asynchronous Mismatch:** The application was configured to use an asynchronous database connection but was trying to use synchronous query methods, which caused the API to crash whenever it tried to fetch data.
3.  **Database Seeding Script Bugs:** The database seeding script was riddled with bugs that prevented it from running to completion, which meant that no data was ever loaded into the database.

These issues have been resolved, and the "Browse Jobs" feature is now functional.

## 2. Failure Mode and Location

The failure mode was a complete backend failure, which manifested as a non-functional "Browse Jobs" page. The failures occurred in the following locations:

*   **Backend Startup:** The application would not start due to missing environment variables and an improperly managed `ProcessPoolExecutor`.
*   **Database Layer:** The application was using synchronous query methods with an asynchronous database connection, which caused `AttributeError` exceptions to be thrown whenever the application tried to fetch data.
*   **Database Seeding Script:** The database seeding script had a number of bugs that prevented it from running to completion, including incorrect enum values, missing `await` calls, and incorrect model attributes.

## 3. Minimal, Verifiable Fixes

The following fixes were implemented to resolve the issues:

*   **`backend/.env`:** Added all required environment variables with dummy values.
*   **`backend/app/core/security.py`:** Modified to use a managed `ProcessPoolExecutor`.
*   **`backend/main.py`:** Added a `lifespan` manager to handle the startup and shutdown of the `ProcessPoolExecutor`.
*   **`backend/app/core/config.py`:** Added the `REDIS_URL` to the `Settings` model.
*   **`backend/app/repositories/`:** Refactored all repositories to use asynchronous queries.
*   **`backend/app/services/`:** Refactored all services to use asynchronous repository methods.
*   **`backend/app/api/routers/`:** Refactored all routers to use asynchronous service methods.
*   **`backend/create_sample_data.py`:** Fixed all bugs in the database seeding script.
*   **`package.json`:** Reverted to the original `start:backend` script.
*   **`backend/setup_db.py`:** Created a new script to create and seed the database.

## 4. Smoke Test Checklist

The following smoke tests were performed to confirm the resolution:

*   **Backend Startup:** The backend server starts up successfully and without any errors.
*   **Frontend Startup:** The frontend server starts up successfully and without any errors.
*   **Browse Jobs Page:** The "Browse Jobs" page loads and displays the sample jobs correctly.

## 5. Postmortem

The root cause of this issue was a lack of a complete and working local development environment. The application had a number of critical bugs that were not caught because the application could not be run locally. To prevent this from happening again, the following measures should be taken:

*   **CI/CD:** A CI/CD pipeline should be implemented to automatically run the tests and deploy the application.
*   **API Health Check:** A more comprehensive API health check should be implemented to ensure that the application is running correctly.
*   **E2E Tests:** Basic end-to-end tests should be written to verify that the application is working as expected.
