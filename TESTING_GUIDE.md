---

## Test Scenario 5: API Endpoints

### Test with cURL or Postman:

```bash
# List all jobs
curl http://localhost:8000/api/jobs/

# Get specific job
curl http://localhost:8000/api/jobs/[job-id]

# List companies
curl http://localhost:8000/api/public/companies/

# List users
curl http://localhost:8000/api/public/users/

# Register new user
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/auth/register \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "email": "newuser@test.com",
    "password": "password123",
    "first_name": "New",
    "last_name": "User",
    "role": "CANDIDATE"
  }'

# Login
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "email": "candidate@demo.com",
    "password": "password"
  }'
```

## Test Scenario 6: File Upload Validation

### Test Invalid Files:
1. Try to upload a .txt file
   - **Expected:** Error: "Please upload a PDF or Word document"

2. Try to upload a file > 10MB
   - **Expected:** Error: "File size must be less than 10MB"

3. Upload valid file types:
   - âœ… PDF (.pdf)
   - âœ… Word Document (.doc)
   - âœ… Word Document (.docx)

---

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: Jobs not loading (showing "0 jobs found")
**Solution:** Wait 2-3 seconds for the API call to complete. The frontend fetches data on mount.

### Issue: Register page shows 404
**Solution:** 
1. Restart the Frontend workflow
2. Clear browser cache
3. Try accessing `/auth/register` directly

### Issue: Apply dialog doesn't open
**Solution:** 
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify you're on the job details page (not the jobs list)
3. Ensure the job has an "Apply Now" button

### Issue: Session expires too quickly
**Note:** Access tokens expire after 15 minutes. This is intentional for security. Refresh tokens last 7 days.

---

## Security Features to Verify

1. âœ… **httpOnly Cookies** - Tokens not accessible via JavaScript
   - Check: Open browser DevTools > Application > Cookies
   - Should see `access_token` and `refresh_token` with HttpOnly flag

2. âœ… **Password Hashing** - Passwords stored as Argon2 hashes
   - Verify: Check database - no plain text passwords

3. âœ… **Authentication Checks** - Apply dialog verifies auth via API
   - Verify: Not checking localStorage, using `/api/auth/me` endpoint

4. âœ… **File Upload Validation** - Type and size checks
   - Test with various file types and sizes

5. âœ… **XSS Protection** - httpOnly cookies prevent token theft
   - Cannot access tokens via `document.cookie` in console
